\section{Discussion}
Discuss your results. You presented your results in the last section, so you do not need to repeat everything here. Just focus on the most interesting results and discuss these.

Was there anything unexpected or weird about your results? What are possible explanations for these observations? It is good to draw on theory. This section and the theory section are the sections where it is natural to have the most references to literature (papers, the book, other).

The discussion section should aim to cover the following:

\quad If the circuit did not work properly, \textit{why} might that be? 

\quad If some of your results turn out differently than you expected: \textit{Why}? You do not have to come to a definite answer, but should try to discuss at least one possible explanation.

\quad Are there any parts of your implementation you would do differently, given another chance?

\quad It could be interesting to discuss the choices you made to reduce static power consumption, and potential improvements to these.


\textbf{Finally, your boss wants to send your design off to your colleague, so that they can create the circuit layout. Are you ready to give the "good to go"-signal, or are there changes or tests you would like to do first?}
