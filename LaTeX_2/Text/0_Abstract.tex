\begin{abstract}
%The abstract \textit{(Norwegian: sammendrag)} should sum up the key points of your report. It is good to include key details here (e.g. concrete numbers describing the design and/or results). In real life, many people stop reading after the abstract. This is your chance to present what your paper/report is all about, and to attract interest from the right readers.
%The abstract should answer the following questions:
%\quad What is this report all about?
%\quad What have you designed?
%\quad Why should I read this thesis?
%\quad What were the key results?
%Length: For a report this length, around half a page would probably be good. Maximum one page.
    This report contains the design of an 8x8-bit memory module for low-power applications. It achieved a simulated leakage current of 2 to \SI{6}{nA} at a supply voltage of \SI{0.99}{V}. The memory module consists of a Finite State Machine acting as a control unit to a clock-independent SRAM. It has a stable analog read/write time of less than \SI{3}{ns}, but requires two clock cycles for write operations, as opposed to a single clock cycle for read operations. The entire system is implemented at a logic gate level, with appendixes containing sufficient Verilog code to digitally simulate the system.
