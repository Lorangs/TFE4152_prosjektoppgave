\section{Simulations and Results}\label{sec:Results}
Present the results of your simulations in this section. Use tables and graphs or other figures to illustrate your results. Remember: The table caption goes above the table, the figure caption goes below the figure.

For each test/simulation, make sure to answer the following: 

\quad Why are you doing this test? 

\quad Can you describe the testbench? E.g. applied stimuli, the circuit being tested etc.

\quad What were the results? Use figures and/or tables to present them. 

\quad Are the results as expected / within spec? \textit{NOTE: This is not the place to discuss why the results are as they are, that should be saved for the discussion-section.}
