\begin{abstract}
    The abstract \textit{(Norwegian: sammendrag)} should sum up the key points of your report. It is good to include key details here (e.g. concrete numbers describing the design and/or results). In real life, many people stop reading after the abstract. This is your chance to present what your paper/report is all about, and to attract interest from the right readers.

    The abstract should answer the following questions:

    \quad What is this report all about?

    \quad What have you designed?

    \quad Why should I read this thesis?
    
    \quad What were the key results?

    Length: For a report this length, around half a page would probably be good. Maximum one page.
