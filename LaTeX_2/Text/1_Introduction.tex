\section{Introduction}
We are given an assignment to design a memory unit to be used in an IoT device. The memory unit is to have a total of 64 bit storage capacity. Furthermore, the system is to have a word length of 8 bit and a read / write time of no longer than \SI{3}{ns}.

All specifications are listed in the assignment sheet \cite{oppgavebeskrivelse}, with necessary theory presented in \autoref{sec:02:theory}. Our implementation of the solution is presented in \autoref{sec:03:method} with following results in \autoref{sec:04:results}. We will discuss our design in greater detail in \autoref{sec:05:discussion} and make some concluding remarks in \autoref{sec:06:conclusion}.
