\section{Conclusion}
Make some concluding remarks. The length of this section should be somewhere between a paragraph and a page.

The conclusion should include your key findings. Make the conclusion as concrete as possible by using numbers for the result (e.g. what was the static power consumption at a given supply voltage).

You should answer the following:

\quad What did you achieve?

\quad Does this align with what you set out to achieve at the start?

\quad Are there any particular results you want to highlight?
