\section{Introduction}

\textit{This document shows the structure expected from your final reports. We follow the IMRaD structure, which you can read more about here: \url{https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/writing-resources/imrad/writing-an-imrad-report}.\\ IMPORTANT: You do not have to use \LaTeX, or even this specific \LaTeX-template. \textbf{What you must follow is the report structure presented in this document.}}.\\

Briefly introduce your project. 

The introduction should answer the following questions:

\quad What is the problem?

\quad What are your specifications?


\quad How is the report structured? (E.g.: Results from simulations are presented in \autoref{sec:Results}).
