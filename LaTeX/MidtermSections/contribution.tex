\section{Contributions}
\textit{A short description of each group memberâ€™s contribution to the work.}

Both members have been working together at campus 6 hours per week since the project started. Sebastian learned Verilog somewhat on his own and kickstarted the Verilog programming on our second work session. Lorang has drawn all circuits on his tablet and implemented updates to the Verilog code between work sessions. Right now, Sebastian is writing this midterm report whilst Lorang has gone to the TA session in order to learn more about AimSPICE for us to implement it sooner rather than later. Both members have been focused on project work when we have our work sessions.
